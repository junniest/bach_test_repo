\section{Conclusion}
A theoretical background for constructing an extensible dynamic macroprocessor
is described in this paper. We provided our view about solving shortcomings
that existing preprocessors have. A parser model is presented. It includes
necessary facilities for the dynamic extension constructing. The description of
macros grammar and type system is given. We use regular expressions as a base
of our match rules. Given regular expression, we construct and minimise DFA to
match tokens effectively. \\
Here are given several examples for demonstrating extension's capabilities.
This can be applied to perform metaprogramming techniques as well as language's
syntax extension. \\
We implemented a prototype that illustrates some feautures of the extension.
There are still bunch of problems to investigate. However, we expect the
project to be helpful in wide areas of language design, compiler optimisations
and macro languages.
