\section{Conclusion}
This paper describes a theoretical background for constructing an extensible
dynamic macroprocessor and provides a view on solving shortcomings that
existing preprocessors have.  We present to the judjment of the reader a parser
model that includes facilities necessary for the dynamic extension
constructing and the syntax we propose for describing macros using regular
expression elements.  We also give several examples to demonstrate the
described extension's capabilities, which can be applied to perform
metaprogramming techniques as well as language syntax extension.  

We have prototyped the described system and plan to develop it further on to
create an actual usable example of the described approach. There are, for sure,
still plenty of issues to tackle and resolve, however, we expect the project to
be helpful in wide areas of language design, compiler optimisations and macro
languages.
